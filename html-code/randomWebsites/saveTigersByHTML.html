                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>The tiger, a symbol of strength and beauty, is one of the most iconic animals in the wild. However,
                    today it faces the serious threat of extinction due to human actions. This article aims to spread
                    awareness about the importance of saving tigers and preserving our natural world.</p>

                <h2>Why Should We Save Tigers?</h2>
                <p>Tigers play a very important role in maintaining the balance of ecosystems. As top predators, they
                    keep populations of other animals in check, which in turn protects vegetation and forests. Saving
                    tigers also means protecting entire forests, which are home to many other species. For India, the
                    tiger is not just the national animal but a proud symbol of our rich wildlife heritage.</p>

                <h2>Major Threats to Tigers</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Poaching:</strong> Tigers are hunted for their skin, bones, and body parts which are
                        used illegally in traditional medicines and decorations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Deforestation:</strong> Large areas of forests are being cut down, leaving tigers
                        without homes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Human-Tiger Conflict:</strong> As humans build farms and homes near forests, tigers come
                        into conflict with people.</li>
                    <li><strong>Climate Change:</strong> Rising temperatures and natural disasters threaten tiger
                        habitats like the Sundarbans.</li>
                </ul>
